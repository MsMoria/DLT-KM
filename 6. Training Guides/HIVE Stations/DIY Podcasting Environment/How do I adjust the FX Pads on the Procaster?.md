# Setting up an FX Pad

To create or edit an effect pad, go to the pad edit screen and either clear a pad and then select ‘FX’ as the type, or click ‘edit’ for an existing FX pad. At the top of the screen, you can select which of the four microphone channels the effects will be applied to. Next to the mic selection buttons is a control labelled ‘Latching’. This switches between two trigger modes: if ‘Latching’ is engaged (highlighted), then pressing the pad will activate the effect, and it will stay activated until the pad is pressed again; if it is not engaged, the pad will only trigger the effect whilst it is being pressed.

NB: As of firmware version 1.1.1, you can only assign one microphone channel to an effect pad at a time. In order to apply effects to multiple microphone channels, you will need to set up and trigger an effect pad per channel. The major benefit of this is that you can now apply different effects to each microphone channel, and these effects are recorded on individual channels in multitrack recording mode, rather than just the main stereo mix.[^1]
